## Overview  
This thesis focuses on developing an **AI-powered mental well-being assistant** that operates **locally** using a **Lightweight Language Model (LLM)**. The system enhances user interaction by integrating **real-time emotion detection** with **deep learning models**.  

## Key Components  

### 1️⃣ Local LLM for Conversations 🤖  
- The assistant runs on a **locally hosted LLM** (e.g., `Llama3`, `DeepSeek`), ensuring **privacy** and **fast responses**.  
- It provides **personalized mental well-being support** through natural and meaningful conversations.  

### 2️⃣ Emotion Recognition via Deep Learning 🎭  
- A **deep learning model** detects the user's **emotional state** in real time.  
- This emotion data helps the chatbot **adapt its responses** to provide better and more empathetic support.  

## Why Is This Important?  

✅ **Privacy-Preserving** – No cloud processing, ensuring user data stays local.  
✅ **Emotion-Aware AI** – Adapts responses based on detected emotions (happy, sad, anxious, etc.).  
✅ **Personalized Support** – Creates a more **empathetic** and **helpful** interaction.  

This system has potential applications in **mental health support**, **stress management**, and **AI companionship**.  

The project is divided into **seven branches**, each handling a specific aspect of the system:  

🔹 **SER (Speech Emotion Recognition)** – Detects emotions from speech using deep learning.  
🔹 **FER (Facial Emotion Recognition)** – Identifies emotions from facial expressions.  
🔹 **Sentient** – Enhances AI emotional intelligence and response adaptation.  
🔹 **Database** – Stores user interactions, emotional insights, and session history.  
🔹 **APIs** – Manages communication between system components.  
🔹 **LLM** – Handles the **local language model** for chatbot responses.  
🔹 **Interface** – Develops the **user-friendly UI** for seamless interactions.
