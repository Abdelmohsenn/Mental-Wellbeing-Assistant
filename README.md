# Mental Well-being Assistance Using Local LLM and Emotion Detection

## Overview  
This thesis focuses on developing an **AI-powered mental well-being assistant** that operates **locally** using a **Lightweight Language Model (LLM)**. The system enhances user interaction by integrating **real-time emotion detection** with **deep learning models**.  

## Key Components  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Local LLM for Conversations ü§ñ  
- The assistant runs on a **locally hosted LLM** (e.g., `Llama3`, `DeepSeek`), ensuring **privacy** and **fast responses**.  
- It provides **personalized mental well-being support** through natural and meaningful conversations.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Emotion Recognition via Deep Learning üé≠  
- A **deep learning model** detects the user's **emotional state** in real time.  
- This emotion data helps the chatbot **adapt its responses** to provide better and more empathetic support.  

## Why Is This Important?  

‚úÖ **Privacy-Preserving** ‚Äì No cloud processing, ensuring user data stays local.  
‚úÖ **Emotion-Aware AI** ‚Äì Adapts responses based on detected emotions (happy, sad, anxious, etc.).  
‚úÖ **Personalized Support** ‚Äì Creates a more **empathetic** and **helpful** interaction.  

This system has potential applications in **mental health support**, **stress management**, and **AI companionship**.
